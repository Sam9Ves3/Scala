## Scala Functional Programming Tutorial ##


Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind 
everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type 
of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to 
an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”. It uses expressions
instead of statements.

Is a way of thinking about software construction by creating pure functions.

I have made a basic tutorial to see how it looks like, take a look
